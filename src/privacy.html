							<h4 class="block-title">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h4>
							<p class="block-descr">Three types of information may be collected on the Site: Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, and Cookies.</p>

							<p class="block-descr">(a) Personal Information</p>
							<p class="block-descr">Personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information. At the time of collection we will set out clearly the information that we are collecting and the purposes for which we will use it. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you will not be able to use certain features of the Site and/or Services and you will not be able to engage in transactions through the Site. We collect the following information about you and your use of our Site and Services in order to create a better, more personalized experience for you: Personal information: an account name or nickname selected by you or assigned by us, your email address, your name (if provided) a password selected by you, your physical address, your billing address, your phone number, your postal or zip code; and Storage box information: for each storage box registered by you, you may choose to create and store a short description or statement which may be viewed by Second Closet; Location data: when you use the Site and Storage Services, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” including location data that you directly provide to us. Location data allows us to provide the Site and Storage Services (e.g., pick up and deliver your Goods), and may also convey to us information about how you browse and use the Site and Storage Services. Some features of the Site, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the main means by which Second Closet may collect Personal Information on this Site: Communications from you to Second Closet; Postings you make on the public areas of the Site (future blog); Purchase of Services; Customer support; Use of the Services; and Surveys. We also may receive Personal Information from our business partners and other third parties, provided that such third parties confirm to us that their use of the Personal Information conforms to applicable privacy laws.</p>

							<p class="block-descr">(b) “Non-Personal Information”</p>
							<p class="block-descr">Information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain used to access the Site, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, average time spent on this Site, and information volunteered by the user, such as survey information, is also considered Non-Personal Information. Business contact information such as the name, title, business address or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.</p>

							<p class="block-descr">(c) Use of Cookies</p>
							<p class="block-descr">Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating the Site and the Services. For example, our web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information which is provided through your browser or stored on a Cookie when you choose to visit the Site. We need this information in order to operate the Services, but we do not share it with any third parties. This policy does not restrict our use of Non-Personal Information. “Cookies” are used by Second Closet to track content usage and traffic on this Site. A cookie is a feature of your web browser that consists of a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a webpage server. Second Closet uses cookies to help it compile aggregate statistics about usage of this Site, such as how many users visit the Site, how long users spend viewing the Site, and what pages are viewed most often. This information is used to improve the content of the Site. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you disable cookies however, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of this Site or our Services. As you browse www.secondcloset.ca, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partner, AdRoll, then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with www.secondcloset.ca. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number. You can visit this page to opt out of AdRoll and their partners’ targeted advertising.</p>

						</div>

						<div class="privacy-block">
							<h4 class="block-title">DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h4>
							<p class="block-descr">Second Closet feels very strongly about keeping the Personal Information you give us confidential. Second Closet will not share the Personal Information we collect from you with any third party, except as indicated in Section 6 below. We may share your information with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing the Site and Storage Services to you. Those business partners will be given limited access to your information as is reasonably necessary to deliver and ensure that your contractual rights are fulfilled. In doing so, we will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy. Further, at times, we may run various pilot projects with other storage sites (business partners) to ensure the most secure options for storage and retrieval are made available to you. In doing so, we will require that such business partners will be given limited access to your information as is reasonably necessary to deliver and ensure that your contractual rights with Second Closet are fulfilled. From time to time we may also employ third parties to help us improve our Site and to provide various services (e.g. hosting, database management, maintenance, etc.). These third parties may have limited access to databases of user information or registered member information solely for the purpose of helping us to provide such services.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="privacy-block">
							<h4 class="block-title">EXCEPTIONS</h4>
							<p class="block-descr">We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party without your consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other Site users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law. We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="privacy-block">
							<h4 class="block-title">OUTSIDE PARTIES AND SITES</h4>
							<p class="block-descr">Through Second Closet, you may be introduced to third party vendors and Sites. The privacy policies of these third parties are not under our control and may differ from ours, including the use of information or content contained therein. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites or services. The use of any information that you may provide to any third party, or the use of “cookie” technology by any third party, will be governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the Site that you are visiting. This includes those websites that have a link or advertisement on our Site. If you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing on another Site, we recommend that you contact that Site directly for more information and review its privacy policy. In addition, we are not responsible for and we do not have any control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service (like Facebook) and you allow such a third-party access to your User Content, you do so at your own risk. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources other than through the Site.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="privacy-block">
							<h4 class="block-title">SECURITY</h4>
							<p class="block-descr">The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that your Personal Information is stored and maintained in a secure environment. In particular, all Personal Information contained in messages sent when using the Services encrypted during transmission to Second Closet is using industry standard authentication and encryption technologies. We protect the Personal Information you give us by putting it behind multiple levels of firewalls, with active intrusion detection systems. You can help protect the security of your Personal Information. For instance, never give out your password to another person, and remember to log out of your account and close your browser window when you finish using the Site, so that other people using the same computer won’t have access to your Personal Information. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="privacy-block">
							<h4 class="block-title">RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
